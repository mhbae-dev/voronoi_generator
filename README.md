# voronoi_generator

This is a program in MAXscript that allows you to transform any chosen object into voronoi cells and then generate a skeleton form/pebbles from this geometry. This script was inspired by the [voronoi diagram]

## How to use

```
To run, press "Run Script" button on the MAXScript utility rollout, File > Run Script in the Listener menu bar, or MAXScript > Run Script in the 3ds Max menu bar. This opens a common File Open dialog for choosing the script. MAXScript then reads and executes the selected script.
```
